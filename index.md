### about

The roots of Hacks/Hackers were planted in 2009, co-founded by Aron Pilhofer of The New York Times, Rich Gordon from Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Burt Herman, a former AP foreign correspondent fresh from a Knight journalism fellowship at Stanford University. Hacks/Hackers grew from an initial chapter in the Bay Area in late 2009 to flourishing chapters in New York, Boston, Austin and other cities during 2010. Hacks/Hackers has also gone international, with chapters launching in Latin America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

Hacks/Hackers’ mission is to create a network of journalists (“hacks”) and technologists (“hackers”) who rethink the future of news and information.
